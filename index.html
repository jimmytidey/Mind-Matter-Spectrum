			<h2>Animism</h2>
		
			<p>Telling stories and anthropomorphising are natural ways to understand the world when you don't have any other explanation to hand. A primitive culture that has not accrued a base of knoweldge that allows it to understand the world will naturally reach for psychological explanations the otherwise unpredictable environment.</p>
		
			<p>Animists give mental properties to everything in the world around them. Plants, animals and places all have "spirits", emotions and intentions. In the animist world view, there is only one type of stuff in the universe: mind-stuff.<p>

			<h2>Implicit Dualism</h2>
			<p>Early philosophy mades an implicit appeal to two kinds of stuff - mind-stuff and physical matter. Plato is the canonical example. Plato said that to perceive the true nature of the you needed to rely on your mental faculties, as all Rationalist philosophers do. This division between the world and and mind implies the posits the existence of a new kind of substance: mind-stuff.</p>

			<h2>Cartesian Explicit Dualism</h2>
			<p>Descartes was the first philosopher to make dualism explicit. His view was that since we can imagine a mind without a body, and a body without a mind, they must be two separate things.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='spectral_line'>
			<h2>Psychological Dualism</h2> 
			<p>In contemporary society most people do not believe in an eternal soul - certainly not in the kind of literal way that Plato or Descartes would have done.</p>
			<p>None the less, we do not think of ourselves as machines - we think of ourselves as having a spirit, as freely willing individuals, despite all the evidence we face in our daily lives.</p> 
		</div>
		
		<div class='spectral_line'>
			<h2>Materialism</h2>
			<p>In the future, humans will accept their material essence. The technology around them will make it impossible to maintain faith in the concept of a spirit.<p>
