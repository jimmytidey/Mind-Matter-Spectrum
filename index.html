	<p><strong>The Mind Matter spectrum is a way of bringing a <a href=''>particular narrative</a> to human history.</strong> Being human has meant very <a href=''>different things over time</a>. The ways we've chosen to answer the question "Is the mind separate from physical matter?" defines a clear progression.</p>

			<h2>Animism</h2>
			<p><em>Mind stuff is pervasive</em></p>
			<p>Projection of psychological features onto everything, since there are few scientific ideas to make sense of the world.
				<ul>
					<li>Aboriginal "dreamtime" Cosmogony</li> 
					<li>Beliefs that plants, animals or places have human spirits</li>
				</ul>		
			</p> 
			
		</div>
		
		
		<div class='spectral_line'>		
			<h2>Implicit Dualism</h2>
			<p><em>Mind-stuff is pure and perfect, physical-stuff is secondary</em><p>
			<p>Emergence of mathematics, deeper thought and complex mental models of the world convince physical stuff is not to be trusted. 
				<ul>
					<li>Plato's theory of forms asks us to look beyond physical-stuff to the true forms - mind-stuff</li>
				</ul>	 
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class='spectral_line'>
			<h2>Cartesian Explicit Dualism</h2>
			<p><em>Mind-matter and physical are formally separately identified for the first time.</em></p>
			<p>Descartes was the first philosopher to make dualism explicit. His view was that since we can imagine a mind without a body, and a body without a mind, they must be two separate things.</p>
			
			
		</div>
		
		<div class='spectral_line'>
			<h2>Psychological Dualism</h2> 
			<p><em>Science and technology erode the uniqueness of mental-matter</em></p>
			<p>Properties considered unique to mental-matter are shown not to be. Despite this, we still treat the two types of matter as separate in our everyday thought.
				<ul>	
					<li>Babbage and automata</li>
					<li>Turing and the Turing test</li>
					<li>fMRI scanning and free will</li>
					<li>Spell checking</li>
				<ul>
			<p>			
		</div>
		
		<div class='spectral_line'>
			<h2>Materialism</h2>
			<p>In the future, just as humans once accepted an animistic or rationalist view of the world, we will accept that the only thing that exists is physical-stuff.
			<ul>
				<li>Dan Dennett's materialism</li> 
				<li>Nick Bostrom and his transhumanism</li>
